# Partner Solutions
There are Microsoft Partner solutions that can extend the capabilities of Azure Stack Hub. This document includes some that have been found useful in deployments of applications running on Kubernetes clusters.  

## Storage and Data solutions

As described in the overview section of the sample solution, Azure Stack Hub currently does not have a native solution to replicate storage across multiple Azure Stack Hub instances. Unlike in Azure, the capability of replicating storage across multiple regions does not exist - each instance is its own distinct cloud.  However, solutions are available from Microsoft Partners that enable storage replication across Azure Stack Hubs and Azure.
